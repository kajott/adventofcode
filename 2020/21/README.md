# [2020, Day 21: Allergen Assessment](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/21)


## Solution Notes

The hardest part of this puzzle is understanding the extremely confusing task description, and deducing that (a) the whole thing is all about what was already done in the second half of part 2 of [day 16](../16), and that (b) a full solution is already required to answer part 1. (At least, I'm not aware of a possible shortcut.) Because of this, I put both parts into one program, as the only difference would be the `print` statement at the very end.
