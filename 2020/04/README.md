# [2020, Day 4: Passport Processing](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/4)


## Solution Notes

This is rather pointless drudgery instead of an intriguing puzzle. All the validations in part 2 are as bland as it gets, the only challenge is in golfing them. At 306 columns, this might be the longest line of code in my whole AoC endeavor so far.

* Part 1, Python: 160 bytes, <100 ms
* Part 2, Python: 446 bytes, <100 ms
