# 2020, Day 24: Lobby Layout


## Solution Notes

Hexagonal grids are always a bit cumbersome to work with, but the tasks are simple enough to make it worthwhile. In the end, I used a tried-and-true representation with dictionaries and sets of complex numbers.

After part 1, I was half expecting part 2 to be something like "the black tiles form letters, please read them", but instead it's a cellular automaton. This makes the puzzle a little less exciting, but it's still fun.

* Part 1, Python: 186 bytes, <100 ms
* Part 2, Python: 402 bytes, ~2 s
