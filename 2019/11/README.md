# 2019, Day 11: Space Police


## Solution Notes

This puzzle puts the Intcode computer into "practical" use, and it's quite a fun thing indeed. The program of part 1 simply performs a few thousand iterations of a [Turmite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turmite)-style cellular automaton; part 2 uses a rather complex algorithm to produce a simple 40x6-pixel bitmap.

* Part 1, Python: 499 bytes, ~500 ms
* Part 2, Python: 561 bytes, ~100 ms
