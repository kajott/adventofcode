## Solution Notes

A nice closed-form solution can be found for part 1, making it (almost) a one-liner. Even though part 2 explicitly calls for tick-by-tick simulation, using this closed-form solution is still a net win in the golfing sense.

* Part 1, Python: 122 bytes, <100 ms
* Part 2, Python: 203 bytes, <100 ms
