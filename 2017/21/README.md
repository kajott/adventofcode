# 2017, Day 21: Fractal Art


## Solution Notes

Since the rules regarding rotations sounded pretty complex, I wrote a non-golf implementation with some visualization and debugging features first. The later golf implementation turned out surprisingly compact, though.

Regarding part 2, I was a little concerned that this might be another exercise in detecting and extrapolating patterns instead of just running the simulation a little longer, but fortunately, the problem size is still well within simulateable bounds.
