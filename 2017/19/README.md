# 2017, Day 19: A Series of Tubes


## Solution Notes

A fun little simulation puzzle that can be solved with multiple representations of the track, position and direction data. I chose a dictionary and complex numbers for brevity.

Since it's trivial to generate results for both parts with almost the same code, but generating a result for only one part saves a few bytes, I've done a combined _and_ separate implementations here.

* Part 1, Python: 262 bytes, <100 ms
* Part 2, Python: 242 bytes, <100 ms
* Parts 1+2, Python: 279 bytes, <100 ms
