## Solution Notes

Part 1 is a simulation of the well-known [Langton's Ant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton's_ant), and part 2 is a specific [Turmite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turmite) variant that interestingly shows purely chaotic behavior. Overall a fun puzzle where complex numbers come in handy for code golf. Note how part 2's rules, while seemingly much more complex, don't translate into significantly more code.

* Part 1, Python: 220 bytes, <100 ms
* Part 2, Python: 229 bytes, ~5 s
