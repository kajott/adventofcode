# 2017, Day 4: High-Entropy Passphrases

A rather unremarkable puzzle. I implemented it using sorting and comparing adjacent elements instead of using a `set` or `dict`. For part 2, the letters in the words themselves are simply sorted too before comparing.

* Part 1, Python: 115 bytes, <100 ms
* Part 2, Python: 132 bytes, <100 ms
