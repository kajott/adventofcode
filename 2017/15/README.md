# 2017, Day 15: Dueling Generators


## Solution Notes

A straightforward simulation task. The many iterations take their time; I'm not aware of any tricks that can speed the process up significantly, other than rewriting the code in a compiled language.

* Part 1, Python: 154 bytes, ~10 s
* Part 2, Python: 195 bytes, ~8 s
