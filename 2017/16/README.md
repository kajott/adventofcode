# [2017, Day 16: Permutation Promenade](https://adventofcode.com/2017/day/16)


## Solution Notes

Part 1 is quite simple, part 2 makes a straightforward implementation unfeasible thanks to a ridiculously large amount of iterations. But like many puzzles of that general scheme, it is eventually solvable by detection a pattern or (in this case) a cycle.

* Part 1, Python: 234 bytes, ~100 ms
* Part 2, Python: 309 bytes, ~750 ms
