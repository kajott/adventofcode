# 2016, Day 6: Signals and Noise

Something is jamming your communications with Santa. Fortunately, your signal is only partially jammed, and protocol in situations like this is to switch to a simple [repetition code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetition_code) to get the message through.

## Part 1

In this model, the same message is sent repeatedly. You've recorded the repeating message signal (your puzzle input), but the data seems quite corrupted - almost too badly to recover. _Almost_.

All you need to do is figure out which character is most frequent for each position. For example, suppose you had recorded the following messages:

    eedadn
    drvtee
    eandsr
    raavrd
    atevrs
    tsrnev
    sdttsa
    rasrtv
    nssdts
    ntnada
    svetve
    tesnvt
    vntsnd
    vrdear
    dvrsen
    enarar
    

The most common character in the first column is `e`; in the second, `a`; in the third, `s`, and so on. Combining these characters returns the error-corrected message, `easter`.

Given the recording in your puzzle input, _what is the error-corrected version_ of the message being sent?

Your puzzle answer was `liwvqppc`.

## Part 2

Of course, that _would_ be the message - if you hadn't agreed to use a _modified repetition code_ instead.

In this modified code, the sender instead transmits what looks like random data, but for each character, the character they actually want to send is _slightly less likely_ than the others. Even after signal-jamming noise, you can look at the letter distributions in each column and choose the _least common_ letter to reconstruct the original message.

In the above example, the least common character in the first column is `a`; in the second, `d`, and so on. Repeating this process for the remaining characters produces the original message, `advent`.

Given the recording in your puzzle input and this new decoding methodology, _what is the original message_ that Santa is trying to send?

Your puzzle answer was `caqfbzlh`.


## Solution Notes

A very satisfying puzzle: each part can be solved in a single, short line of code, and the only difference between the parts is `min` vs. `max`.
