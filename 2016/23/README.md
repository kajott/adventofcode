# 2016, Day 23: Safe Cracking

This is one of the top floors of the nicest tower in EBHQ. The Easter Bunny's private office is here, complete with a safe hidden behind a painting, and who _wouldn't_ hide a star in a safe behind a painting?

The safe has a digital screen and keypad for code entry. A sticky note attached to the safe has a password hint on it: "eggs". The painting is of a large rabbit coloring some eggs. You see `7`.

When you go to type the code, though, nothing appears on the display; instead, the keypad comes apart in your hands, apparently having been smashed. Behind it is some kind of socket - one that matches a connector in your [prototype computer](../11)! You pull apart the smashed keypad and extract the logic circuit, plug it into your computer, and plug your computer into the safe.

## Part 1

Now, you just need to figure out what output the keypad would have sent to the safe. You extract the [assembunny code](../12) from the logic chip (your puzzle input).

The code looks like it uses _almost_ the same architecture and instruction set that the [monorail computer](../12) used! You should be able to _use the same assembunny interpreter_ for this as you did there, but with one new instruction:

`tgl x` _toggles_ the instruction `x` away (pointing at instructions like `jnz` does: positive means forward; negative means backward):

*   For _one-argument_ instructions, `inc` becomes `dec`, and all other one-argument instructions become `inc`.
*   For _two-argument_ instructions, `jnz` becomes `cpy`, and all other two-instructions become `jnz`.
*   The arguments of a toggled instruction are _not affected_.
*   If an attempt is made to toggle an instruction outside the program, _nothing happens_.
*   If toggling produces an _invalid instruction_ (like `cpy 1 2`) and an attempt is later made to execute that instruction, _skip it instead_.
*   If `tgl` toggles _itself_ (for example, if `a` is `0`, `tgl a` would target itself and become `inc a`), the resulting instruction is not executed until the next time it is reached.

For example, given this program:

    cpy 2 a
    tgl a
    tgl a
    tgl a
    cpy 1 a
    dec a
    dec a
    

*   `cpy 2 a` initializes register `a` to `2`.
*   The first `tgl a` toggles an instruction `a` (`2`) away from it, which changes the third `tgl a` into `inc a`.
*   The second `tgl a` also modifies an instruction `2` away from it, which changes the `cpy 1 a` into `jnz 1 a`.
*   The fourth line, which is now `inc a`, increments `a` to `3`.
*   Finally, the fifth line, which is now `jnz 1 a`, jumps `a` (`3`) instructions ahead, skipping the `dec a` instructions.

In this example, the final value in register `a` is `3`.

The rest of the electronics seem to place the keypad entry (the number of eggs, `7`) in register `a`, run the code, and then send the value left in register `a` to the safe.

_What value_ should be sent to the safe?

Your puzzle answer was `11760`.

## Part 2

The safe doesn't open, but it _does_ make several angry noises to express its frustration.

You're quite sure your logic is working correctly, so the only other thing is... you check the painting again. As it turns out, colored eggs are still eggs. Now you count `12`.

As you run the program with this new input, the prototype computer begins to _overheat_. You wonder what's taking so long, and whether the lack of any instruction more powerful than "add one" has anything to do with it. Don't bunnies usually _multiply_?

Anyway, _what value_ should actually be sent to the safe?

Your puzzle answer was `479008320`.


## Solution Notes

This puzzle is based on a very weird kind of self-modifying code that makes reverse-engineering harder than it needs to be. Unfortunately, understanding what the code does *is* required to solve part 2, because the problem size is almost 100k times as large as it was for part 1. In the end it turns out to compute <span style="color:silver;background:silver;">the factorials of 7 or 12</span>, plus a fixed offset that's encoded as two constants in the code<span style="color:silver;background:silver;">, multiplied together</span>. So the only sane way to solve part 2 is to grab these constants (it's generally the two largest numbers in the input code) and perform the computation on the host side.

* Part 1, Python: 367 bytes, <100 ms
* Part 2, Python: 100 bytes, <100 ms
