## Solution Notes

A simple simulation task that takes quite a lot of time to run, especially for part 2. An experimental transpiler that converts the "assembunny" code into C can compute each part's result in less than 100 milliseconds -- that is, *including* the transpilation and C compilation steps!

* Part 1, Python: 270 bytes, ~500 ms
* Part 2, Python: 275 bytes, ~20 s
