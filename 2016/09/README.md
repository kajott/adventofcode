# 2016, Day 9: Explosives in Cyberspace


## Solution Notes

I accidentally implemented part 2 first, with full string expansion. Let's just say that things didn't go as well as expected ... it's really important to only compute the *length* of the data in part 2, not the data itself.

Regarding part 1: that's just a simplified version of part 2 without recursion applied.

* Part 1, Python: 155 bytes, <100 ms
* Part 2, Python: 186 bytes, <100 ms
