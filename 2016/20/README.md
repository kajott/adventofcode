## Solution Notes

Both parts require coming up with a good first idea for an algorithm, which took me some time. Conveniently, the solution for part 2 can be built upon the solution for part 1.

I was really surprised of just how restrictive the "blacklist" is ...

* Part 1, Python: 127 bytes, <100 ms
* Part 2, Python: 179 bytes, <100 ms
