## Solution Notes

A very simple task, and part 2 is actually even simpler than part 1. The nice thing is that there are again many ways to implement it: A 2D array of characters is fine, but so is a flat coordinate-to-character mapping. I ended up with my usual complex numbers as coordinate representation.

* Part 1, Python: 180 bytes, ~300 ms
* Part 2, Python: 172 bytes, <100 ms
