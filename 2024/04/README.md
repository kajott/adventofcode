# 2024, Day 4: Ceres Search

"Looks like the Chief's not here. Next!" One of The Historians pulls out a device and pushes the only button on it. After a brief flash, you recognize the interior of the [Ceres monitoring station](../../2019/10)!

As the search for the Chief continues, a small Elf who lives on the station tugs on your shirt; she'd like to know if you could help her with her _word search_ (your puzzle input). She only has to find one word: `XMAS`.

## Part 1

This word search allows words to be horizontal, vertical, diagonal, written backwards, or even overlapping other words. It's a little unusual, though, as you don't merely need to find one instance of `XMAS` - you need to find _all of them_. Here are a few ways `XMAS` might appear, where irrelevant characters have been replaced with `.`:

    ..X...
    .SAMX.
    .A..A.
    XMAS.S
    .X....

The actual word search will be full of letters instead. For example:

    MMMSXXMASM
    MSAMXMSMSA
    AMXSXMAAMM
    MSAMASMSMX
    XMASAMXAMM
    XXAMMXXAMA
    SMSMSASXSS
    SAXAMASAAA
    MAMMMXMMMM
    MXMXAXMASX

In this word search, `XMAS` occurs a total of _`18`_ times; here's the same word search again, but where letters not involved in any `XMAS` have been replaced with `.`:

    ....XXMAS.
    .SAMXMS...
    ...S..A...
    ..A.A.MS.X
    XMASAMX.MM
    X.....XA.A
    S.S.S.S.SS
    .A.A.A.A.A
    ..M.M.M.MM
    .X.X.XMASX

Take a look at the little Elf's word search. _How many times does `XMAS` appear?_

Your puzzle answer was `2464`.

## Part 2

The Elf looks quizzically at you. Did you misunderstand the assignment?

Looking for the instructions, you flip over the word search to find that this isn't actually an _`XMAS`_ puzzle; it's an _`X-MAS`_ puzzle in which you're supposed to find two `MAS` in the shape of an `X`. One way to achieve that is like this:

    M.S
    .A.
    M.S

Irrelevant characters have again been replaced with `.` in the above diagram. Within the `X`, each `MAS` can be written forwards or backwards.

Here's the same example from before, but this time all of the `X-MAS`es have been kept instead:

    .M.S......
    ..A..MSMS.
    .M.S.MAA..
    ..A.ASMSM.
    .M.S.M....
    ..........
    S.S.S.S.S.
    .A.A.A.A..
    M.M.M.M.M.
    ..........

In this example, an `X-MAS` appears _`9`_ times.

Flip the word search from the instructions back over to the word search side and try again. _How many times does an `X-MAS` appear?_

Your puzzle answer was `1982`.

## Solution Notes

A very simple task, and part 2 is actually even simpler than part 1. The nice thing is that there are again many ways to implement it: A 2D array of characters is fine, but so is a flat coordinate-to-character mapping. I ended up with my usual complex numbers as coordinate representation.

* Part 1, Python: 180 bytes, ~250 ms
* Part 2, Python: 172 bytes, <100 ms
