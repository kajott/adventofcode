# 2022, Day 5: Supply Stacks


## Solution Notes

This is one of the puzzles where the task itself is nearly trivial, but parsing the input and picking a suitable representation for the data is where the (still not too excessive) complexity lies.

After several rounds of miniaturization, I ended up in a state where part 2 is actually shorter than part 1, simply because the order of the moved elements is reversed in part 1, while it's kept intact in part 2.

* Part 1, Python: 282 bytes, <100 ms
* Part 2, Python: 276 bytes, <100 ms
