# [2022, Day 3: Rucksack Reorganization](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/3)


## Solution Notes

Just intersections of sets, nothing special to see here.

An x86 DOS implementation of this task is still perfectly in the realm of the possible; having to implement bitfield-based sets from scratch isn't _that_ much fun, though -- and it takes a surprisingly high amount of code space too.

* Part 1, Python: 122 bytes, <100 ms
* Part 2, Python: 128 bytes, <100 ms
* Parts 1+2, x86 DOS Assembly: 306 bytes (assembled)
