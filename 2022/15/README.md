# 2022, Day 15: Beacon Exclusion Zone

You feel the ground rumble again as the distress signal leads you to a large network of subterranean tunnels. You don't have time to search them all, but you don't need to: your pack contains a set of deployable _sensors_ that you imagine were originally built to locate lost Elves.

The sensors aren't very powerful, but that's okay; your handheld device indicates that you're close enough to the source of the distress signal to use them. You pull the emergency sensor system out of your pack, hit the big button on top, and the sensors zoom off down the tunnels.

## Part 1

Once a sensor finds a spot it thinks will give it a good reading, it attaches itself to a hard surface and begins monitoring for the nearest signal source _beacon_. Sensors and beacons always exist at integer coordinates. Each sensor knows its own position and can _determine the position of a beacon precisely_; however, sensors can only lock on to the one beacon _closest to the sensor_ as measured by the [Manhattan distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry). (There is never a tie where two beacons are the same distance to a sensor.)

It doesn't take long for the sensors to report back their positions and closest beacons (your puzzle input). For example:

    Sensor at x=2, y=18: closest beacon is at x=-2, y=15
    Sensor at x=9, y=16: closest beacon is at x=10, y=16
    Sensor at x=13, y=2: closest beacon is at x=15, y=3
    Sensor at x=12, y=14: closest beacon is at x=10, y=16
    Sensor at x=10, y=20: closest beacon is at x=10, y=16
    Sensor at x=14, y=17: closest beacon is at x=10, y=16
    Sensor at x=8, y=7: closest beacon is at x=2, y=10
    Sensor at x=2, y=0: closest beacon is at x=2, y=10
    Sensor at x=0, y=11: closest beacon is at x=2, y=10
    Sensor at x=20, y=14: closest beacon is at x=25, y=17
    Sensor at x=17, y=20: closest beacon is at x=21, y=22
    Sensor at x=16, y=7: closest beacon is at x=15, y=3
    Sensor at x=14, y=3: closest beacon is at x=15, y=3
    Sensor at x=20, y=1: closest beacon is at x=15, y=3
    

So, consider the sensor at `2,18`; the closest beacon to it is at `-2,15`. For the sensor at `9,16`, the closest beacon to it is at `10,16`.

Drawing sensors as `S` and beacons as `B`, the above arrangement of sensors and beacons looks like this:

                   1    1    2    2
         0    5    0    5    0    5
     0 ....S.......................
     1 ......................S.....
     2 ...............S............
     3 ................SB..........
     4 ............................
     5 ............................
     6 ............................
     7 ..........S.......S.........
     8 ............................
     9 ............................
    10 ....B.......................
    11 ..S.........................
    12 ............................
    13 ............................
    14 ..............S.......S.....
    15 B...........................
    16 ...........SB...............
    17 ................S..........B
    18 ....S.......................
    19 ............................
    20 ............S......S........
    21 ............................
    22 .......................B....
    

This isn't necessarily a comprehensive map of all beacons in the area, though. Because each sensor only identifies its closest beacon, if a sensor detects a beacon, you know there are no other beacons that close or closer to that sensor. There could still be beacons that just happen to not be the closest beacon to any sensor. Consider the sensor at `8,7`:

                   1    1    2    2
         0    5    0    5    0    5
    -2 ..........#.................
    -1 .........###................
     0 ....S...#####...............

    22 .......................B....
    

This sensor's closest beacon is at `2,10`, and so you know there are no beacons that close or closer (in any positions marked `#`).

None of the detected beacons seem to be producing the distress signal, so you'll need to work out where the distress beacon is by working out where it _isn't_. For now, keep things simple by counting the positions where a beacon cannot possibly be along just a single row.

So, suppose you have an arrangement of beacons and sensors like in the example above and, just in the row where `y=10`, you'd like to count the number of positions a beacon cannot possibly exist. The coverage from all sensors near that row looks like this:

                     1    1    2    2
           0    5    0    5    0    5
     9 ...#########################...
    10 ..####B######################..
    11 .###S#############.###########.
    

In this example, in the row where `y=10`, there are _`26`_ positions where a beacon cannot be present.

Consult the report from the sensors you just deployed. _In the row where `y=2000000`, how many positions cannot contain a beacon?_

Your puzzle answer was `5181556`.

## Part 2

Your handheld device indicates that the distress signal is coming from a beacon nearby. The distress beacon is not detected by any sensor, but the distress beacon must have `x` and `y` coordinates each no lower than `0` and no larger than `4000000`.

To isolate the distress beacon's signal, you need to determine its _tuning frequency_, which can be found by multiplying its `x` coordinate by `4000000` and then adding its `y` coordinate.

In the example above, the search space is smaller: instead, the `x` and `y` coordinates can each be at most `20`. With this reduced search area, there is only a single position that could have a beacon: `x=14, y=11`. The tuning frequency for this distress beacon is _`56000011`_.

Find the only possible position for the distress beacon. _What is its tuning frequency?_

Your puzzle answer was `12817603219131`.

## Solution Notes

This task is interesting in that there are many different ways to solve it that all work, but most of them are too inefficient to be feasible, especially in part 2. For part 1, simple sets of X coordinates at the queried Y position work fine; using some kind of representation that can encode and intersect individual ranges efficiently would be much faster, but also a lot more code. I used this approach for part 2 initially, but since part 2 queries 4 million times the rows compared to part 1, it's quite slow and very memory-hungry.

There are, however, quite a few strategies to make the search more efficient:
- The elusive beacon must be on the intersection of the boundaries of at least four scanners to be unique; anything less than four, and it would be a line. (By "boundary", I mean the diamond that's _one larger_ that the scanner range.) I implemented a solution based on this approach in a scratchpad, but without any further optimizations, it's no better than the naive coordinate range scan.
- The contributing boundaries need to be laid out in a special way: There need to be (at least) two that share a boundary in diagonal (`\`) direction and (at least) two others that share a boundary in anti-diagonal (`/`) direction. Sharing a boundary means that the Manhattan distance between the scanners must be the sum of the boundary radii (which, in turn, are the scanner range plus 1, so the total difference is the sum of scanner ranges plus 2). <br> For all contest inputs (but, interestingly, not the example input), it seems that there are exactly two pairs of such scanners, so we can deem it safe to use this as a heuristic.
- After identifying the four relevant scanners, intersecting the boundaries of those is sufficient. An analytical solution would be ideal, but this exceeds my grasp of maths.
- To speed up the intersection process (and, in my case just as important, save a lot of code), it's sufficient to just examine one of the four lines of each sensor's boundary diamond, specifically the line facing the sought-after sensor. <br> But wait, that's a catch-22, right? We don't know the beacon's position yet! That's right, but what we _do_ know is that it needs to be somewhere inside the quadrilateral formed by the scanner's centers. A coarse approximation of the beacon position is absolutely sufficient for that, and the centroid of the quadrilateral can be used for that.

With all these optimizations applied, part 2 becomes reasonably small and quick.

* Part 1, Python (set of coordinates): 200 bytes, ~1 s
* Part 2, Python (coordinate ranges): 379 bytes, ~3 min, 7 GiB RAM
* Part 2, Python (heuristics and boundary intersection): 340 bytes, ~1.5 s
