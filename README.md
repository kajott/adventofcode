# Advent of Code Puzzle Solutions

This repository contains the puzzles and my solutions for the popular [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) online programming puzzle tournament.

My solutions are mostly written in Python 2.7, with the occasional C implementations where Python's performance is problematic. In both cases, the solutions are attempts at [code golf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf), so please don't expect any well-commented, easily understandable, extensible code here! The following exceptions are made:

* The code is still meant to be reasonably efficient in terms of runtime performance.
* The name of the input file is `input.txt`, not just a single letter.
* C code is "self-compiling" when marked executable on Unix (i.e. it compiles and runs itself, making the C program more or less behave like a script).
* A "she-bang" is however *not* included for Python files.
* C code uses the occasional line break where it's not strictly necessary to make it at least a tiny bit readable.
