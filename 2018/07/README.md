# 2018, Day 7: The Sum of Its Parts


## Solution Notes

The first part was reasonably easy to solve, but the second part caused me a few headaches. In the end, I had a strange off-by-one error: For the simple scenario in the example, my code produced the correct answer, but for the actual puzzle input, the result was exactly one too much. I still don't understand what the problem is.

* Part 1, Python: 246 bytes, <100 ms
* Part 2, Python: 408 bytes, <100 ms
