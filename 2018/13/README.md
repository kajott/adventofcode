# 2018, Day 13: Mine Cart Madness


## Solution Notes

This puzzle is rather frustrating because bugs creep in far too easy and if they do, you don't have any idea what exactly went wrong -- you just get an incorrect result, and that's it. For example, I was stuck for a while because my crashed cart removal code was buggy: it sometimes removed the wrong carts, but that only happened on the real input, not in the examples :(
