# 2018, Day 18: Settlers of The North Pole


## Solution Notes

This puzzle is very similar to 2018 day 12: A straightforward cellular automaton simulation (this time in 2D) with an absurdly large iteration count. Again, the task in part 2 is to recognize a pattern in the output over time; specifically, that there is a cycle in which the whole world's state starts to oscillate after a few hundred iterations.

* Part 1, Python: 457 bytes, <100 ms
* Part 2, Python: 562 bytes, ~3 s
